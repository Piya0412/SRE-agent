# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Which pods are in CrashLoopBackOff in production?

```markdown
## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: The investigation was initiated to identify pods in CrashLoopBackOff state within the production namespace. However, the specific results of which pods are in this state were not provided.
- **Impact**: Potential service instability or performance degradation if critical pods are in CrashLoopBackOff, but the exact impact cannot be determined without further details.
- **Severity**: Medium (Potential for significant issues if critical pods are affected, but exact severity is unclear without more information)

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): 
   - Execute `kubernetes_get_pods(namespace="production")` again to retrieve the current list of pods and identify those in CrashLoopBackOff.
   - Assess the criticality of the pods found to be in CrashLoopBackOff.
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): 
   - Investigate the logs and events for the identified pods to determine the cause of the CrashLoopBackOff state.
   - Apply necessary fixes or rollbacks to resolve the issue.
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): 
   - Implement monitoring and alerting for pods entering CrashLoopBackOff to prevent future incidents.
   - Review and enhance the deployment configurations to avoid similar issues.

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- None at this time, but continuous monitoring is recommended to identify and address any pods entering CrashLoopBackOff promptly.
