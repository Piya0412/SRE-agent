# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** List all pods in production namespace and their status

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Authentication/credentials issue preventing access to Kubernetes production namespace
- **Impact**: Service visibility disruption - unable to retrieve pod status
- **Severity**: Medium

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): 
   - Validate Kubernetes cluster authentication credentials
   - Verify network connectivity to cluster
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours):
   - Confirm production namespace access permissions
   - Manually check pod status using `kubectl get pods -n production`
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week):
   - Review cluster access management procedures
   - Audit authentication and authorization configurations
4. **Follow-up**: 
   - Engage cluster administrator to resolve access issues

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Potential access control or network connectivity problem preventing pod status retrieval
- Unable to confirm current production environment health through standard tooling

The summary is intentionally conservative, reflecting the limited evidence of a potential access issue rather than confirming an actual service disruption. Immediate investigation is recommended to validate the root cause and restore visibility into the production environment.

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- I apologize for the error. This appears to be a temporary system issue preventing direct pod retrieval. Let me provide some additional context and recommended next steps:

1. The k8s-api tool encountered an authentication or credentials problem when trying to access the production namespace.

2. Recommended troubleshooting steps:
   - Verify your Kubernetes cluster authentication is correctly configured
   - Check if there are any network connectivity issues
   - Confirm you have the necessary permissions to access the production namespace

3. Alternative investigation methods:
   - Use `kubectl get pods -n production` directly in your terminal
   - Consult your cluster's monitoring dashboard
   - Contact your cluster administrator to investigate the access issue

4. If you'd like me to help further, please:
   - Confirm the namespace name
   - Verify your cluster access credentials
   - Provide any additional context about the access problem

I apologize that I couldn't retrieve the pod list automatically due to the system error. Would you like me to help you troubleshoot the access issue?

### Application Logs Agent
- I apologize, but I cannot directly list the pods or their status using the log analysis tools available to me. As the Application Logs Agent, I'm limited to log-related functions and do not have direct Kubernetes cluster management capabilities.

Recommended actions to obtain pod status:
1. Use kubectl command: `kubectl get pods -n production`
2. Check your Kubernetes cluster's web dashboard
3. Review your cluster's monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
4. Consult with your cluster administrator or DevOps team

Key troubleshooting points:
- Verify namespace name is exactly "production"
- Ensure you have appropriate cluster access credentials
- Check network connectivity to the Kubernetes cluster

Log tools used: search_logs (returned error due to credential issue)

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
