# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** List all pods in production namespace and their status

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: API throttling errors preventing access to monitoring and investigation tools
- **Impact**: Investigation capability degradation - unable to assess actual system state
- **Severity**: Medium - Investigation tools impaired but no direct evidence of service impact

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour):
   - Switch to direct kubectl/logging tools to assess production environment
   - Verify production service status through alternative monitoring channels

2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours):
   - Investigate cause of API throttling
   - Implement retry backoff strategy for monitoring tools

3. **Long-term** (< 1 week):
   - Review and adjust API rate limits
   - Implement circuit breakers for monitoring systems
   - Set up redundant monitoring paths

4. **Follow-up**:
   - Audit monitoring tool resilience
   - Review API quota management

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Unable to determine actual production environment status due to monitoring tool failures
- Investigation capabilities currently impaired

Note: This summary focuses on the monitoring system degradation itself, as the investigation tools failed before being able to assess the actual state of production pods. The severity is rated as Medium because while our visibility is impaired, we don't have evidence of actual service impacts.
