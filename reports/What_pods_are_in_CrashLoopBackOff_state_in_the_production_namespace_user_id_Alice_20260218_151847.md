**Query:** What pods are in CrashLoopBackOff state in the production namespace?

```markdown
## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: The Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent encountered a critical error (`ModelErrorException`) during the execution of the query, preventing the retrieval of pod statuses in the production namespace.
- **Impact**: Unable to determine the status of pods due to agent failure. Potential performance degradation or service instability in the production environment if pods are in CrashLoopBackOff state.
- **Severity**: High. The failure of the monitoring agent to provide necessary data could lead to undetected issues in the production environment.

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): 
   - Investigate and resolve the `ModelErrorException` in the Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent to restore monitoring capabilities.
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): 
   - Verify the status of all pods in the production namespace once the agent is operational.
   - Identify and address any pods found to be in CrashLoopBackOff state.
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): 
   - Implement additional monitoring and alerting for agent health to prevent future incidents.
   - Review and enhance error handling within the Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent to mitigate similar issues.

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- The failure of the Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent to execute queries poses a risk to the timely detection and resolution of pod issues in the production environment.

**Note:** The summary is adapted to an "executive" communication style, focusing on business impact and operational implications, as per the provided guidelines.

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Agent execution failed: An error occurred (ModelErrorException) when calling the Converse operation: Model produced invalid sequence as part of ToolUse. Please refer to the model tool use troubleshooting guide.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
